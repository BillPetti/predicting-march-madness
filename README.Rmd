## Predicting March Madness

Kaggle's March Madness competition is a fun introduction to machine learning.  And if you happen to like college basketball, you'll like that in this competition you can't bust your bracket, since you make a prediction for every game.

In 2016, my simple process using tidyverse functions in R placed in the top 10%.  I refined it a bit for 2017 and finished in the top 25%.

I'm sharing my code and process here for others to use as a starting point.

## What's here

In the Kaggle competition, you estimate how likely it is that Team A beats Team B, for each of the >1,000 possible matchups in the tournament.  **[My guide](march_madness_how_to.md)** documents a set of scripts for each step of:

* Deciding on possible input parameters
* Scraping the input data with the `rvest` package
* Cleaning and joining data sources to get tidy, prediction-ready data
* Training and evaluating machine learning models on the data
* Making and submitting predictions
