## Predicting March Madness

I entered the March Mania competition on Kaggle in 2016.  It was my first foray into machine learning and the competition makes for a fun introductory opportunity.  My simple process, using tidyverse functions in R, placed in the top 10%.

I'm sharing my code and process here for others to use as a starting point to learn from.

## What's here

In the March Mania competition, you estimate how likely it is that Team A beats Team B, for each of the >1,000 possible matchups in the tournament.  [My guide](march_madness_how_to.Md) annotates the code and process for each step of:

* Deciding on possible input parameters
* Scraping the input data with the rvest package
* Cleaning and joining data sources to get tidy, prediction-ready data
* Training and evaluating machine learning models on the data
* Making and submitting predictions
