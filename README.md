Predicting March Madness
------------------------

I entered the March Mania competition on Kaggle in 2016. It was my first foray into machine learning and the competition makes for a fun introductory opportunity. My simple process, using tidyverse functions in R, placed in the top 10%.

I'm sharing my code and process here for others to use as a starting point to learn from.

What's here
-----------

In the March Mania competition, you estimate how likely it is that Team A beats Team B, for each of the &gt;1,000 possible matchups in the tournament. [My script](march_madness_how_to.Rmd) annotates the code and process for each step of:

-   Deciding on possible input parameters
-   Scraping web data with the rvest package
-   Cleaning and joining data sources to get tidy, prediction-ready data
-   Training and evaluating machine learning models on the data
-   Making and submitting predictions
